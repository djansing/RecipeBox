12 ounces pasta (I used Linguine)
1 can (15 ounces) diced tomatoes with liquid ( I used zesty red pepper flavor)
1 large sweet onion, cut in julienne strips
4 cloves garlic, thinly sliced
0.5 teaspoon red pepper flakes
2 teaspoons dried oregano leaves
2 large sprigs basil, chopped
4.5 cups vegetable broth (regular broth and NOT low sodium)
2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
Parmesan cheese for garnish
*
Place pasta, tomatoes, onion, garlic, basil, in a large stock pot. Pour in 
vegetable broth. Sprinkle on top the pepper flakes and oregano. Drizzle 
top with oil.

Cover pot and bring to a boil. Reduce to a low simmer and keep covered 
and cook for about 10 minutes, stirring every 2 minutes or so. Cook until 
almost all liquid has evaporated – I left about an inch of liquid in the bottom 
of the pot – but you can reduce as desired .

Season to taste with salt and pepper, stirring pasta several times to distribute 
the liquid in the bottom of the pot. Serve garnished with Parmesan cheese.
