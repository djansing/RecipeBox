2.5 cups all-purpose flour, plus extra for rolling
1 cup unsalted butter, very-cold, cut into 1/2 inch cubes*
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon sugar
6 Tbsp ice water
*
1 Put flour, sugar, and salt into the bowl of a food processor and pulse a 
couple times to mix. Add about half of the butter to the food processor and 
pulse several times. Then add the rest of the butter and pulse 6 to 8 times 
until the largest pieces of butter are about the size of large peas. Sprinkle the 
mixture with about 1/4 cup of ice water (make sure there are no ice cubes in 
the water!) and pulse again. Then add more ice water, a tablespoon at a time, 
pulsing once or twice after each addition until the dough just barely begins to 
hold together.

You know that the mixture is ready if when you pinch some of the crumbly 
dough together with your fingers, it holds together. Be cautious with the amount 
of water you add, too much and the crust will be tough.

2 Carefully empty the crumbly dough mixture from the food processor on to a 
clean, dry, flat surface. Gather the mixture in a mound. At this point, if you 
want, you can do what the French call fraisage: push down with the palm of your 
hand on the dough crumbles a few times. This will help flatten the pieces of 
butter into layers which will help your crust be flaky.

Divide the dough mixture into two even-sized mounds. Use your hands to form 
each one into a disk. Do not over-knead! Kneading develops gluten which will 
toughen the dough, not something you want in a pastry crust.

If you started with cold butter you should be able to see small chunks of butter 
speckling the dough. This is a good thing. These small bits of butter will spread 
out into layers as the crust cooks so you have a flaky crust!

Sprinkle each disk with a little flour, wrap each one in plastic wrap, and 
refrigerate for one hour or up to 2 days.

3 Remove one crust disk from the refrigerator. Let sit at room temperature 
for 5-10 minutes in order to soften just enough to make rolling out a bit easier. 
Roll out with a rolling pin on a lightly floured surface to a 12-inch circle; 
about 1/8 of an inch thick. As you roll out the dough, check if the dough is
sticking to the surface below. If necessary, add a few sprinkles of flour under 
the dough to keep the dough from sticking. Carefully place onto a 9-inch pie 
plate. Gently press the pie dough down so that it lines the bottom and sides 
of the pie plate. Use a pair of kitchen scissors to trim the dough to within 1/2 
inch of the edge of the pie dish.

4 Add filling to the pie.

5 Roll out second disk of dough, as before. Gently place onto the top of the 
filling in the pie. Pinch top and bottom of dough rounds firmly together. 
Trim excess dough with kitchen shears, leaving a 3/4 inch overhang. Fold 
the edge of the top piece of dough over and under the edge of the bottom 
piece of dough, pressing together. Flute edges using thumb and forefinger 
or press with a fork. Score the top of the pie with four 2-inch long cuts, so 
that steam from the cooking pie can escape.
