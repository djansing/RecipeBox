27  ounces pasta (I used Linguine)
2.25 can (15 ounces) diced tomatoes with liquid ( I used zesty red pepper flavor)
2.25 large sweet onion, cut in julienne strips
9  cloves garlic, thinly sliced
1.125 teaspoon red pepper flakes
4.5 teaspoons dried oregano leaves
4.5 large sprigs basil, chopped
10.125 cups vegetable broth (regular broth and NOT low sodium)
4.5 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
0.0 cheese for garnish
*
Place pasta, tomatoes, onion, garlic, basil, in a large stock pot. Pour in 
vegetable broth. Sprinkle on top the pepper flakes and oregano. Drizzle 
top with oil.

Cover pot and bring to a boil. Reduce to a low simmer and keep covered 
and cook for about 10 minutes, stirring every 2 minutes or so. Cook until 
almost all liquid has evaporated – I left about an inch of liquid in the bottom 
of the pot – but you can reduce as desired .

Season to taste with salt and pepper, stirring pasta several times to distribute 
the liquid in the bottom of the pot. Serve garnished with Parmesan cheese.
