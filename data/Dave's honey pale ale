2 cans light malt syrup
1 pound honey
2 oz Cascade hops
1 packet ale yeast

Bring 3 gallons of water to a boil, then remove from heat.
Put malt syrup into water, stir until dissolved, then return to heat.
When wort resumes boiling, add hops.
After 45 minutes from start of boil, add honey.
After 60 minutes from start of boil, remove from heat.
Cool to around 85 degrees as quickly as possible, 
then pour wort into primary fermenter.  
Top off with water to five gallons, pitch yeast into wort, 
close lid tightly and install airlock.

After primary fermentation is complete (about one week), 
rack beer to secondary fermenter and install airlock.  
Allow to age for two more weeks before bottling.
